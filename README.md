Integrating Bayesian Optimization (BO) into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for gravitational wave classification yields comparable accuracy (84.34%) to the base model (83.61%), but requires additional computational resources and time. BO's performance improvement is not significant, making the base model more resource-efficient for this task.
